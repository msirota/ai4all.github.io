        <h1>Program Overview</h1>

        <p>UCSF AI4ALL is a program promoting greater diversity and inclusion in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Our mission is to inspire
		tomorrowâ€™s leaders to know, think about, and use artificial intelligence ethically. During the program, participants receive broad
		exposure to Artificial Intelligence topics through faculty lectures and field trips, as well as an in-depth experience with a research
		area through hands-on projects. Mentoring and career/personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, and graduate students
		further enable personal growth and an opportunity to explore career interests at the intersection of Computer Science and Biomedicine.
		We are committed to serving students of all financial backgrounds. [ Read our article

        <!-- Update with the typical daily schedule for your program -->
        <h1>Typical Daily Schedule</h1>

        <p>The weekly schedule consists of days split between lectures and demonstrations in the morning, and time to work on a hands-on research project in the afternoons.</p>

        <p>Days begin with lectures from UCSF faculty and graduate students, followed by teaching and demonstrations. During the presentations, participants engage with the day's lecturer and ask questions about their work and involvement in AI.</p>

        <p>After lunch, participants work on their research projects that will be presented at the end of the third week. Participants work closely with UCSF graduate students, who serve as research instructors, to apply the machine learning techniques they learn to real problems and datasets and to get hands-on experience with how using AI tools can be applied to biomedicine.</p>

        <p>Participants have time to interact with graduate students and postdocs to provide mentoring and help develop personal growth. They learn how to get involved in the AI community. There will be field trips, as well as panels hosted by our industry sponsors so students can learn about career opportunities in AI and how they can stay connected with the community.</p>

        <p>Below is a sample schedule:</p>
