        <h1>Program Overview</h1>

        <p>UCSF AI4ALL is a program promoting the field of Artificial Intelligence providing early exposure to non–wet lab biomedical research and data-driven discovery. Our mission is to inspire
		tomorrow’s leaders to know, think about, and use statistics and computational methods to apply how the concepts of statistical inference, distributions, significance, and confounding are approached in medicine. During the program, students will  participate in mentored research
		and structured enrichment activities over the summer, culminating in a presentation and/or additional academic output as applicable at the end of the program. Based on demonstrated progress and achievement of milestones, students may have the opportunity to continue their research
		into the fall semester and beyond. Mentoring and career/personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, and graduate students
		further enable personal growth and an opportunity to explore career interests at the intersection of Computer Science and Biomedicine.
		We are committed to serving students of all financial backgrounds.</p>

        <h2>Who Should Apply?</h2>

        The program targets <!-- current--> <b>SFUSD juniors (Class of 2027) who are taking/have taken AP Statistics and/or AP Computer Science. 

     </b> <!-- (rising seniors) -->

        <h2>Important Dates</h2>

        <p><b>Application Deadline: March 2026. Stay tuned for specific date </b></p>

        <h2>Program Location</h2>

        The 2026 program will take place on the Mission Bay UCSF campus in San Francisco, California. 
		Lectures and research will be conducted at the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute in Mission Bay. 
		Students will be expected to attend sessions in person by commuting to campus every day of the program
		(on-campus housing will not be provided). Students must provide their own transportation and a personal laptop (encrypted & password-protected).

        <!-- Update with the typical daily schedule for your program -->
       <!-- <h1>Typical Daily Schedule</h1>

        <p>The weekly schedule consists of days split between lectures and demonstrations in the morning, and time to work on a hands-on research project in the afternoons.</p>

        <p>Days begin with lectures from UCSF faculty and graduate students, followed by teaching and demonstrations. During the presentations, participants engage with the day's lecturer and ask questions about their work and involvement in AI.</p>

        <p>After lunch, participants work on their research projects that will be presented at the end of the third week. Participants work closely with UCSF graduate students, who serve as research instructors, to apply the machine learning techniques they learn to real problems and datasets and to get hands-on experience with how using AI tools can be applied to biomedicine.</p>

        <p>Participants have time to interact with graduate students and postdocs to provide mentoring and help develop personal growth. They learn how to get involved in the AI community. There will be field trips, as well as panels hosted by our industry sponsors so students can learn about career opportunities in AI and how they can stay connected with the community.</p>

        <p>Below is a sample schedule:</p>
